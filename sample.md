# What is a Slidedoc? {.two}
## The way we communicate is changing. In our time-strapped world, we like information that is consumed quickly. 
This has led organizations to look for a way to fill the gap between long-form documents and presentations. What has emerged are slidedocs.

A slidedoc is a visual document intended to be read and referenced instead of projected. Slidedocs work for a variety of communication scenarios, from sales collateral to in-meeting reference material. And because of their modular nature, slidedocs can spread your smart thinking throughout your organization.

## 
Effective slidedocs are developed by knowing your audience, understanding how they consume information, and by having one clear big idea. Developing effective slidedocs also requires visualizing ideas and making the information easy to navigate. 
Slidedocs are one of the most effective tools for communicating ideas quickly and establishing consensus. Your ideas deserve the best possible communication vehicle. Slidedocs are designed for the way we communicate today.

> This template accommodates longer-form reading material

# Slidedocs are Like Books {.two-half}
## 
Slidedocs borrow some specific design aspects from books. Books have a cover, table of contents, clear chapter indicators, prose, page numbers, and other small design decisions that have big information architecture implications to help readers navigate the contents.
Flipping through the pages of a slidedoc should feel similar to flipping through the printed pages of a book or swiping the screen of a tablet device.

## The masters are set up for prose and have plenty of white space. Each page holds just the right amount of information to process quickly.

# Master Layout Options {.one}
Each master is segmented into sections that would accommodate prose and graphics. There are various layouts already predesigned into the masters that will help you break up your content into bite-sized chunks that make your slidedoc much easier to read.

# Typographic Hierarchy {.two}
## If you type in the field to the right titled “Click to add text”, you get this rust text style. This is used for highlighting pieces of text for a subtitle, subhead, or main callouts.

### Hit return and tab and the text changes to charcoal and you now have a paragraph header style applied.

#### Hit return and tab again and it changes to a size that works great for body copy titles
Hit return and tab again and it changes to a size that works great for body copy. This efficient way of setting up the master template to create typographic hierarchy is unique to slidedocs.

+ A fourth tab sequence is a bullet

## Try it now for yourself to  the right.

# Flat Design Visual Style {.one-half}
Each slidedoc should have a consistent visual language. Have clear typeset hierarchy, constrained color palette and consistent illustration style. There are many reasonably priced illustrations available. The trick is to make sure they hang together like a family. Below are places you can get illustrations priced from free to a few dollars.:
