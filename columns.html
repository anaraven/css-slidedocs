<h1>A short history of molecular biology and <em>(un-)</em>related technologies</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>30’s: At Berlin, Herzog and others create X-Ray diffraction devices to study polymer fibres, that will enable the study of DNA. When Hitler got into power, Herzog moved to Istanbul University.</li>
<li>40’s: Second World War fostered new technologies, such as atomic bombs, rockets and computers for military operations. IBM predicted that “there is a market for 5 computers in the world”.</li>
<li>50’s: DNA structure decoded. Cars were big and expensive. Computers too. They used a big special room and only a few specialist had access to them. Banks and big companies used them for accounting. Main producer is IBM. People read “Popular Mechanics”.</li>
<li>60’s: Genetic code decoded. A few universities had one (and only one) computer. Main producer is IBM. Programs are stored in punched cards. People read “Popular Electronics”.</li>
<li>70’s: Closet size computers (racks). Unix is invented. People could repair their own cars, even make new ones, such as “buggies”.</li>
<li>1975: Hobbyists form “Computer clubs” and start making toy 8 bit computers like earlier Radio Amateurs. See “Popular Electronics”. Silicon Valley is born. Many companies, including Apple, sold personal computers with up to 64 KB RAM and 1 MHz CPU. Storage was usually cassette tape. IBM ignores them.</li>
<li>80’s: IBM starts producing “Personal Computers”, which are followed by hundreds of copies, cheaper and improved. IBM brand promotes the idea, but IBM role in the computer market reduces to almost zero. Computers appear in labs, researchers use them to solve small models and to write papers. 1984: Apple introduces the first Macintosh, the first massive usage of mouse and windows interface. Also produced medium cost laser printers. Graphics design industry is revolutionised. First Local Area Networks appear. Internet grows slowly between American universities. PCR is invented.</li>
<li>90’s Northern blot invented Microarrays invented. Internet becomes worldwide available</li>

<h1>Molecular Biology on the Information Era</h1>
<p>The Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Istanbul University was created 12 years ago. In the following years it consolidated as a well respected department, attracting each year 40-60 of the best students in the country, which can later follow Masters and Doctorate post-degrees. It has published XXX papers, mainly on plant genomics and fission yeast as a model for human metabolism. Our department got quickly up-to-date with modern molecular biology theory and practice.</p>
<p>During the same period, the public awareness and in molecular interest biology has increased constantly. The sequencing of the human genome, made public by the president of USA, captured everybody's attention. Scientist from many areas of biology, but also physicists, mathematicians, computer scientist and engineers, turned their capabilities to questions arising from molecular biology, looking with new eyes and creating new theoretical and practical tools.</p>
<p>Molecular biology, as other sciences, has been and keeps being transformed by the interaction with computers and networks. Information and communication technologies are tools that transform the way of doing science. Some of these transformations are easily seen, others are subtle and visible only to experts on specific areas.</p>
<p>The first transformation is the availability of molecular biology instruments that produce huge volumes of experimental data at a constantly decreasing cost. Microarrays allow us to see how gene expression changes under different conditions; they are fabricated by computer-controlled robots, read by computer-controlled scanners and processed with software on desktop computers. DNA sequencing has become cheap and fast using clever molecular techniques producing a huge number of images that are processed by an advanced computer to produce several gigabases in a few hours. Assembling the resulting reads into full chromosomes requires also a significant amount of computer power implementing advanced theoretical models which are currently an active research area. Computers are behind most modern molecular biology experimental devices.</p>
<p>The second transformation arrived with the Internet. Before it we used to go to the library and read printed papers, take note of the references, send a letter to the author and, hopefully, get a preprint back by mail in a few months. Now we just click on the references and in most cases a PDF is immediately available. Knowledge used to be expensive and concentrated on rich countries or universities, which had the money to pay for books and journals. Now the biggest part of scientific publications is free or can be accessed at a low cost. Books are delivered on electronic format or can be purchased on-line. In old times one could only find them in specialized book stores abroad, so only a few professors had access to them. Today all professors <em>and students</em> have access to top-level text books.</p>
<div id="more-opportunities-but-also-more-competition" class="section level2">
<h2>More opportunities but also more competition</h2>
<p>This democratization of knowledge has been called <em>the flat world</em> (<span class="citation">@friedman2007world</span>) and provides us with an exciting challenge. Rich countries have no longer the monopoly of knowledge. We can read the same books and the same papers. Anyone can use it to make the new scientific breakthrough, either in New York, New Delhi or Istanbul. The <em>entry costs</em> are much lower now. This represents a big opportunity for us, to play in the big leagues in a levelled surface. But is also an opportunity for everyone else, so competition is harder.</p>
<p>Moreover, the experimental results of these publication are also available in digital form and freely accessible to anyone, in most cases, specially when experiments were funded with public money. Most journals only accept papers whose results can be replicated from the raw data, and database services such as GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information and the European Bioinformatics Institute of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory provide a <em>structured</em> organization for this data. Having structured data means that it is readily available for further analysis. There is no need to spend time searching, copying and pasting from the paper to the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>And since modern molecular biology instruments produce nowadays enormous volumes of data (a <em>data tsunami</em>), they are only partially analysed before publishing. Anyone with a computer, an internet connection and the right computational tools can use these data to publish new analysis or meta-analysis, without an immediate need of experiments. One can download several databases, explore correlations, formulate hypothesis, design an experiment and hire an outsourcing lab to carry on the validation.</p>

<div id="web-2.0-and-social-media-on-science" class="section level2">
<h2>Web 2.0 and Social Media on Science</h2>
<p>Social media development has resulted in two important topics: big data and theoretical models for network analysis.</p>
<p>Big Data came into life when companies such as google tackled the challenge of indexing the whole web. Allows vision from 30.000 ft</p>
<p>Computer were initially, and still are irreplaceable calculating devices, but also have become powerful communication devices. open source and collaboration. Linux, theorem proving, wikipedia</p>
<p>Cloud</p>
<p>MOOC allow anyone to learn from top universities and get certified by them. There is a language barrier, since most of these lectures are in English, but young people is quickly learning foreign languages. Will you hire an MIT certified technician who learned on-line? If he/she does a good job then probably so. Nowadays many people works in the software industry without any formal education. And a lot of technical work is almost just software.</p>
<p>Social media fosters collaboration. Communication, Collaborative theorem proving. Crowdsourcing.</p>
